Generated with the template `server-shelf`

```
$ dart create -t server-shelf docker_process_issue
```

When using the default Dockerfile, the resulting container cant
spawn child processes via `Process.start` or `Process.run`

The issue seems to be with `FROM SCRATCH`, removing it fixes the issue

# GENERATED README:
_______

A server app built using [Shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf),
configured to enable running with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

This sample code handles HTTP GET requests to `/` and `/echo/<message>`

# Running the sample

## Running with the Dart SDK

You can run the example with the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
like this:

```
$ dart run bin/server.dart
Server listening on port 8080
```

And then from a second terminal:
```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080
Hello, World!
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080/echo/I_love_Dart
I_love_Dart
```

## Running with Docker

If you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed, you
can build and run with the `docker` command:

```
$ docker build . -t myserver
$ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 myserver
Server listening on port 8080
```

And then from a second terminal:
```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080
Hello, World!
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080/echo/I_love_Dart
I_love_Dart
```

You should see the logging printed in the first terminal:
```
2021-05-06T15:47:04.620417  0:00:00.000158 GET     [200] /
2021-05-06T15:47:08.392928  0:00:00.001216 GET     [200] /echo/I_love_Dart
```
